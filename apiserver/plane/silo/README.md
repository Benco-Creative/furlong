# Silo App

The Silo app is a Plane's application designed to handle isolated and secure operations for external integrations and importers, background tasks, and data processing.

## Directory Structure

- Each model should handle a specific integration or feature
- Keep sensitive data models isolated

### 📁 views/
API endpoints and view logic.
- REST API views
- Integration webhook handlers
- Authentication views for external services

### 📁 utils/
Helper functions and utility code.
- Common helper functions
- Shared utilities across the silo app
- Integration-specific utilities

### 📁 urls/
URL routing configurations.
- API endpoint routing
- Webhook URL configurations
- Integration callback URLs

### 📁 bgtasks/
Background task definitions and handlers.
- Celery tasks
- Async job processors
- Scheduled tasks

### 📁 management/
Django management commands.
- Custom management commands
- Data migration scripts
- Utility commands

### 📁 migrations/
Database migration files.
- Auto-generated migrations
- Custom data migrations
- Migration dependencies

### 📁 tests/
Test cases and test utilities.
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Test fixtures and utilities

## Key Files

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Adding New Endpoints**
   - Create models in `models/`
   - Add views in `views/`
   - Define URLs in `urls/`
   - Add utility functions in `utils/`

2. **Background Tasks**
   - Add new tasks in `bgtasks/`
   - Register tasks with Celery
   - Handle task failures and retries

3. **Testing**
   - Add tests in `tests/`
   - Follow test naming conventions
   - Include fixtures as needed

4. **Management Commands**
   - Add new commands in `management/commands/`
   - Document command usage
   - Include help text

## Best Practices

1. **Security**
   - Keep sensitive data encrypted
   - Use environment variables for secrets
   - Implement proper authentication

2. **Code Organization**
   - Follow Django conventions
   - Keep related code together
   - Document complex logic

3. **Guidelines**
   - Handle rate limits
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Log important events

4. **Performance**
   - Use background tasks for heavy operations
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Monitor task queues

## Contributing

1. Follow the project's coding standards
2. Add tests for new features
